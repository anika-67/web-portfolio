        <h1> About Life</h1>
<div class="box-a">
    <h2>Happy Life</h2>
<h3><span>let's discuss some good things!</span></h3>
<p>Happy people satisfy their wants and needs, but that seems largely irrelevant to a meaningful life. Happiness involves being focused on the present, whereas meaningfulness involves thinking more about the past, present, and future—and the relationship between them. Health, wealth, and ease in life were all related to happiness</p>
</div>
<div class="box-b">
    <h2>Meaningful Life</h2>
<h3><span>let's discuss some successful things!</span></h3>
<p>Meaningfulness is derived from giving to other people; happiness comes from what they give to you. Meaningful lives involve stress and challenges. Higher levels of worry, stress, and anxiety were linked to higher meaningfulness. Self-expression is important to meaning but not happiness.</p>
